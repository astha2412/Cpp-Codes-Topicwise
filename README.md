# Step-by-Step Guide for beginners for getting started with C++

## What is C++?
**`C++`** is a statically typed, compiled, general-purpose, case-sensitive, free-form programming language that supports procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming.

C++ is regarded as a middle-level language, as it comprises a combination of both high-level and low-level language features.

C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup starting in 1979 at Bell Labs in Murray Hill, New Jersey, as an enhancement to the C language and originally named C with Classes but later it was renamed C++ in 1983.

C++ is a superset of C, and that virtually any legal C program is a legal C++ program.

<h1> C++ Environment SetupðŸ’»</h1>
</div>

## Local Environment Setup :-
If you are still willing to set up your environment for C++, you need to have the following two softwares on your computer.
## Text Editor
This will be used to type your program. Examples of few editors include Windows Notepad, OS Edit command, Brief, Epsilon, EMACS, and vim or vi.

The files you create with your editor are called source files and for C++ they typically are named with the extension .cpp, .cp, or .c.

## C++ Compiler
Most frequently used and free available compiler is GNU C/C++ compiler, otherwise you can have compilers either from HP or Solaris if you have the respective Operating Systems.

<h1> Object-Oriented Programming</h1>
</div>

C++ fully supports object-oriented programming, including the four pillars of object-oriented development-
1. **`Encapsulation`**
1. **`Data Hiding`**
1. **`Inheritance`**
1. **`Polymorphism`**

<div align="center">
<h1> Standard Libraries</h1>
</div>
Standard C++ consists of three important parts âˆ’

1. The core language giving all the building blocks including variables, data types and literals, etc.

2. The C++ Standard Library giving a rich set of functions manipulating files, strings, etc.

3. The Standard Template Library (STL) giving a rich set of methods manipulating data structures, etc.

<h1> C++ Basic Syntax</h1>
<img width="50%" align="center" src="../CPP/img/Hello_World.jpeg"><br><br>
</div>
When we consider a C++ program, it can be defined as a collection of objects that communicate via invoking each other's methods. Let us now briefly look into what a class, object, methods, and instant variables mean.

1. **`Object`** âˆ’ Objects have states and behaviors. Example: A dog has states - color, name, breed as well as behaviors - wagging, barking, eating. An object is an instance of a class.
<br>
2. **`Class`** âˆ’ A class can be defined as a template/blueprint that describes the behaviors/states that object of its type support.
<br>
3. **`Methods`** âˆ’ A method is basically a behavior. A class can contain many methods. It is in methods where the logics are written, data is manipulated and all the actions are executed.
<br>
4. **`Instance Variables`** âˆ’ Each object has its unique set of instance variables. An object's state is created by the values assigned to these instance variables.

<h1> C++ Storage Classes</h1>
</div>
A storage class defines the scope (visibility) and life-time of variables and/or functions within a C++ Program. These specifiers precede the type that they modify. There are following storage classes, which can be used in a C++ Program-
<ul>
<li>auto</li>
<li>register</li>
<li>static</li>
<li>extern</li>
<li>mutable</li>
</ul>

<h1> C++ Operators</h1>
</div>
An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical manipulations. C++ is rich in built-in operators and provide the following types of operators âˆ’
<ul>
<li>Arithmetic Operators</li>
<li>Relational Operators</li>
<li>Logical Operators</li>
<li>Bitwise Operators</li>
<li>Assignment Operators</li>
<li>Misc Operators</li>
</ul>

<div align="center">
<h1> C++ Loop types</h1>
</div>
There may be a situation, when you need to execute a block of code several number of times. In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on.

Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.

A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times and following is the general from of a loop statement in most of the programming languages âˆ’


<ul>
<li>while loop</li>
<li>for loop</li>
<li>do while loop</li>
<li>nested loops</li>
<li></li>
<li></li>

</ul>
